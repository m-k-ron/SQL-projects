#SQL restaurant database
In this project, we will be working with a SQL database containing two tables: 'menu_items' and 'order_details'. The 'menu_items' table contains the menu items and their prices, while the 'order_details' table contains the details of each order, including the order date, the item ordered, and the quantity ordered.
